# Music-Generation-Using-Transformer
This project explores the application of Transformer-based models for generating musically coherent sequences in MIDI format. By leveraging the MAESTRO dataset of annotated piano performances, the model captures the temporal patterns and dependencies necessary for creating expressive and diverse music.
